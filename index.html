                Why You Should Learn <br> Basic Coding Skills
            </h1>
            <p class=" " id="">
                Coding, which was once an outlier, is now one of the most sought-after skills in the job marketplace.
                Between now and 2030, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects about 9,700 new job openings 
                each year for computer programmers as others retire or change occupations. As these workers leave the 
                industry, who’s going to replace them? <br> 
                Here’s the good news: you don’t need a computer science degree to become a programmer and learn 
                coding languages. You can join other self-taught learners and develop a skill set that improves 
                your access to new job opportunities.

                “What good will it do anyone to live inside a bubble?” <br>
                It is a question that yields an answer that is easier said than done.
                Most people have their hands full with the struggles posed by everyday life. 
                The continuous battle against crime and poverty has been inching on the side of 
                victory in the recent years, however, there still much needed to be done. 
                Rehabilitation for the past economic fallout has turned people’s focus inwardly, 
                shying away from the issues of the world at large.
